<div style="text-align: justify">This project is a pilot project during internship. I built recommender systems for recommending products to user using Model-based recommendation system. The goal of this project is to make a recommendation system model that is more accurate than the previous model. <b>The model achieve the best performance with SVD++ where this model gets an RMSE score of 0.844 and MAE 0.384. I also use the mlflow tool to do experiment tracking.</b>

<div style="text-align: justify">This project was started as a motivation for learning Machine Learning Algorithms and to learn the different data preprocessing techniques and <b>implement the concept of Homodescascity, Multicollinearity & Error terms distribution during data exploration. I also deploy this project in heroku. This model get R2 score of 73% and RMSE of 5.09</b>.

<div style="text-align: justify">The objective of this project is to <b>analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order</b>. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are done to study customer purchase patterns and for better product marketing and cross-selling. <b>Achieved the best performance using the XGBoost model with an AUC score of 0.83, an accuracy of 0.74 and an F1-score of 0.36.</b></div>

<div style="text-align: justify"><b>In this project I conducted analysis and predictions related to turnover</b> on employee data in a company. Analysis is carried out to look for factors that cause turnover while predictions are used to predict which employees will make turnover. <b>This project also carried out several techniques such as normalization and sampling </b>(due to imbalanced data). After modeling using several classification models, especially the tree algorithm, it was found that <b>LightGBM produced the best performance with F1-score = 91% and ROC-AUC Score = 91%.This project uses kedro as a framework.</b></div>
